        <p>Cats are the best pet to have. All they do is eat and sleep.
        they don't need attention 24/7. They come and go whenever. 
        And best of all, they have 9 lives. Your cat may or may not hate you. 
        </p>
        <p>Dogs on the otherhand need to be attend to often. They require daily exercise.
        Owning a dog may take up alot of your times. But they are very loyal and makes good friends.
        Sadly for dogs, they only have 1 live.
